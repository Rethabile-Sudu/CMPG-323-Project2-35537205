# CMPG-323-Project2-35537205
The NWU Tech Trends project involves developing a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API designed to interact with a database storing basic telemetry data. This API will enable seamless communication between different systems, environments, interfaces, and applications by providing standardized HTTP endpoints to perform operations on the stored data.

Key Components of the Project:

CRUD Operations:

Create (POST): Allows users to add new telemetry data to the database.
Read (GET): Retrieves telemetry data from the database.
Update (PATCH): Modifies existing telemetry data in the database.
Delete (DELETE): Removes telemetry data from the database.
RESTful API Architecture:

The API will be built following REST principles, ensuring a stateless, client-server communication model over HTTP.
Each resource (e.g., telemetry data) will have its own set of endpoints for CRUD operations, providing a clear and organized structure.
Cloud Integration:

The API is designed to be managed via cloud services, offering scalability, reliability, and ease of deployment.
Stakeholder Usage of the Developed Report
The report developed as part of this project serves as a guide and documentation for stakeholders, including developers, IT administrators, project managers, and business analysts, outlining how to interact with the API and use its functionalities.

How Stakeholders Can Use the Report:

Developers:

Use the report to understand the API's architecture and endpoints.
Reference the report during development to ensure proper implementation and integration with other systems.
IT Administrators:

Use the report to manage and monitor the API, ensuring it operates smoothly within the cloud environment.
The report can help in troubleshooting any issues that arise during API usage.
Project Managers:

Utilize the report to track the progress of the API development and ensure that it meets the project's requirements.
The report provides a clear overview of the API's functionality, aiding in communication with other stakeholders.
Business Analysts:

Use the report to understand how the API facilitates data management and supports business operations.
The report can assist in identifying potential areas for enhancement and optimization of the API.
The report ensures that all stakeholders have a clear understanding of the RESTful API's design, functionality, and management, enabling them to effectively use and maintain the system in alignment with the project's goals.
